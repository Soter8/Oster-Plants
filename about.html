    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Oster Plants, your homegrown plant paradise!</p>
    <p>Our journey began with a simple passion for plants. It all started when we found joy in splitting bushes and sharing them with friends and family. What began as a humble backyard hobby quickly grew into something more.</p>
    <p>Driven by our love for plants, we ventured into selling them on Facebook and now right here on our website. Each plant you find here has been nurtured with care, starting from just a tiny cutting.</p>
    <p>We believe in the power of nature and the connection it brings to our lives. Our mission is to share our passion for homegrown plants with you, helping you bring a touch of green into your space.</p>

    <h2>Cash is King</h2>
    <p>At Oster Plants, we value simplicity and authenticity. That's why we operate on a "cash is king" policy. We accept cash as the primary mode of payment for all our products.</p>
    <p>We believe that dealing in cash helps us stay true to our roots and ensures that our focus remains on what truly matters - the plants and the community that shares our love for them.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being a part of our journey, and we look forward to sharing the beauty of homegrown plants with you!</p>
